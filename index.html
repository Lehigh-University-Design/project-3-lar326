            <p>Billie Jean King is an American tennis player who held the #1 world tennis player position for 6 years. Starting tennis at age 11 she would go on to turn pro in 1959 at age 16. Her first international recognition was in 1961 when she became ½ of the youngest pair to ever win the Wimbledon women’s doubles title. Throughout her career Billie Jean went on to win 20 Wimbledon titles, 13 US titles, and 39 total grand slam titles.</p>

                    <p>Billie Jean Moffit was born November 22, 1943, in Long Branch California. Growing up she was competitive in multiple sports before ultimately finding tennis. She was introduced to the sport by her father, who took her to local courts to play. Billie Jean quickly developed a passion for tennis and showed remarkable talent from a young age. She began playing competitively in her early teens, laying the foundation for what would become a legendary career in the sport. She attended California State University in Los Angeles, but did not graduate, as she left school in 1964 to focus on competing in tournaments. BJK would also go on to marry Larry King in 1965.</p>

                    <p>Billie Jean has been an advocate for equality and social justice from a young age. One of her first injustices that fueled this work was at a tournament when she was younger. Billie Jean was forbidden from being a part of a group photo because she was wearing tennis shorts that her mother had made her instead of the usual white tennis dress. As her career progressed she began to advocate for equal prize money between men and women’s competitions. In 1970 at the Pacific Southwest Open the prize money for men was $12,500 and for women was $1,500. This resulted in Billie Jean and 8 other women refusing to play and began to start a women’s only tournament. In 1971 by winning the Virginia Slims Tour for women, she became the first women athlete to win over $100,000 in prize money. In 1973, the US open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money to both sexes.</p>

King co-founded the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and the Women's Sports Foundation, organizations that have played crucial roles in advancing women's sports and promoting equality in athletics.

                        Additionally, Billie Jean King has been involved in various philanthropic endeavors, including initiatives aimed at promoting access to sports and education for underserved communities. She continues to be a prominent speaker and activist, using her platform to champion causes related to diversity, inclusion, and empowerment.
